This notice must be sent within 20 days after the date of the loss for which claim is being made. Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim. If a claim cannot be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior to the expiration of the 45 days. The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss. Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial.

This notice must be sent within 20 days after the date of the loss for which claim is being made. Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim. If a claim cannot be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior to the expiration of the 45 days. The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss. Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial. This policy has been updated effective January 1, 2014 PART IV - BENEFITS GC 6018 Section D - Claim Procedures, Page 1\",\n          \"A claimant may request an appeal of a claim denial by Written request to The Principal within 180 days of receipt of notice of the denial. The Principal will make a full and fair review of the claim. The Principal may require additional information to make the review. The Principal will notify the claimant in Writing of the appeal decision within 45 days after receipt of the appeal request. If the appeal cannot be processed within the 45-day period because The Principal did not receive the requested additional information, The Principal is permitted a 45-day extension for the review. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. After exhaustion of the formal appeal process, the claimant may request an additional appeal. However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action. For purposes of this section, \\\"claimant\\\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim. The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy. The Principal will pay for any such autopsy. Article 7 - Legal Action Legal action to recover benefits under this Group Policy may not be started earlier than 90 days after required proof of loss has been filed and before the appeal procedures have been exhausted. Further, no legal action may be started later than three years after that proof is required to be filed. Article 8 - Time Limits Any time limits in this section will be adjusted as required by law. This policy has been updated effective January 1, 2014 PART IV - BENEFITS GC 6018 Section D - Claim Procedures, Page 2\",\n          \"c . a copy of the form which contains the statement is given to the insured or the insured's beneficiary at the time insurance is contested. However, these provisions will not preclude the assertion at any time of defenses based upon the person's ineligibility for insurance under this Group Policy or upon the provisions of this Group Policy. In addition, if an individual's age is misstated, The Principal may at any time adjust premium and benefits to reflect the correct age. Article 6 - Information to be Furnished The Policyholder must, upon request, give The Principal all information needed to administer this Group Policy. If a clerical error is found in this information, The Principal may at any time adjust premium to reflect the facts. An error will not invalidate insurance that would otherwise be in force. Neither will an error continue insurance that would otherwise be terminated. The Principal may inspect, at any reasonable time, all Policyholder records, which relate to this Group Policy. Article 7 - Certificates The Principal will give the Policyholder Certificates for delivery to insured Members. The delivery of such Certificates will be in either paper or electronic format. The Certificates will be evidence of insurance and will describe the basic features of the coverage. They will not be considered a part of this Group Policy. Article 8 - Assignments No assignments of Member Life Insurance will be allowed under this Group Policy. Article 9 - Dependent Rights A Dependent will have no rights under this Group Policy except as set forth in PART III, Section F, Article 2.

This notice must be sent within 20 days after the date of the loss for which claim is being made. Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim. If a claim cannot be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior to the expiration of the 45 days. The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss. Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial.

The Principal will make a full and fair review of the claim. The Principal may require additional information to make the review. The Principal will notify the claimant in Writing of the appeal decision within 45 days after receipt of the appeal request. If the appeal cannot be processed within the 45-day period because The Principal did not receive the requested additional information, The Principal is permitted a 45-day extension for the review. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. After exhaustion of the formal appeal process, the claimant may request an additional appeal. However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action. For purposes of this section, \\\"claimant\\\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim. The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy. The Principal will pay for any such autopsy. Article 7 - Legal Action Legal action to recover benefits under this Group Policy may not be started earlier than 90 days after required proof of loss has been filed and before the appeal procedures have been exhausted. Further, no legal action may be started later than three years after that proof is required to be filed. Article 8 - Time Limits Any time limits in this section will be adjusted as required by law.
